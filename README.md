# Don'tDriveMeMad

## Don'tDriveMeMad is a [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that stops the FullBodyCalibrator for snapping to odd positions.

More specifically, this mod will enable "DontDrive" on the sliders that make up the full body calibrator grab handles.

This prevents the odd behavior where dropping them causes them to snap to snap to slightly off or undesirable angles (or in the case of non-focused headlesses, *extremely* undesirable angles)

Enjoy not going mad anymore!
